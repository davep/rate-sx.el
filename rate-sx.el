;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `rate-sx.el' provides a main command, `rate-sx', which displays the
;; output of http://rate.sx in a buffer.
;;
;; Other commands provide ways to quickly calculate currency totals, they
;; include:
;;
;; `rate-sx-calc'
;;
;; Show the result of a currency calculation in the minibuffer. Calculations
;; are things like "1BTC+12ETH" (would show the total value, in the base
;; currency defined by `rate-sx-default-currency', of holding 1 BTC and 12
;; ETH).
;;
;; `rate-sx-calc-region'
;;
;; Same as above but takes the input from the content of the marked region.
;;
;; `rate-sx-calc-maybe-region'
;;
;; Same as above again, but performs `rate-sx-calc-region' if there is an
;; active mark, otherwise it performs `rate-sx-calc'.
